Hello everyone :)

I just wanted to give some pointers for those who wish to tell my story and tell how I’m doing right now (or how I been feeling lately). I know that my absence had some consequences for some, either bad or good. You see, I wasn't perfect and I'm still not today, but I will always be working to be a better person for a better world.

However, I wouldn't want wrong facts to be said as I am someone who values transparency, honesty and accountability.

- Make sure you have receipts of your claims

- Make sure your claims are about ME and not someone who looks like me (I know a couple of people who looks like me or wish to walk in my shoes, but lemme tell you, don't for your own good)

- If you have voice recordings or videos, make sure it is MY voice and MY face (I have a quebecois accent tabeurnak)

- If you have receipts or text conversations, make sure they're not Ai made or from scammers, nowadays you can do a lot with Ai and people have bad habits to impersonate

- For the past 1 year, I stopped using face unlock and touch ID unlock on my phones and tablet. Had some old friends playing tricks on me when I was sleeping, otherwise. I will say this and if you wish to speak about it to me, I will be glad to answer all your questions and concerns with honesty: What is sent in private, is private to me. In my dictionary, if a women shows herself to me, it's because I gained her trust and trust is something I cherish above all, just like loyalty. 

- Make sure the receipts you have, were either given by me, real conversation with me or legally taken -> If I ever hear some were taken illegally, I would be vary vary frustrated and creeped out ;)

- If you have some videos, make sure it was ME on it or that I wasn't acting, because remember how much I like watching Impractical Jokers

- Make sure that you respect the timelines of events, bad timelines doesn't hold ground in my dictionary and people can change with time (Not everyone but you get it right)

- If you have claims about stuff related to MY DNA, make sure it is MY DNA. I have a couple of samples done at some places, ask me about it

- If you have claims about stuffs related to MY fingerprints, make sure they are MY fingerprints. I also have a couple of fingerprints done at some places

- If you do false claims to evade accountability or betrayal, work on yourself please

- If you make claims about what I say, make sure I wasn't being racist or using dark humor

Why am I saying that? Because I have receipts for pretty much everything. I always document my stuff and so far, no one proved me that I was being too much :)

Oh and funny thing, still no ones are ready to have that conversation with me :)

Finally, I don't mind if you insult me or judge me based on what I did or said, I've done so much shit in the past as an immature younging that today, I'm learning how to actually be a good adult for the past 2 years. However, what I would mind is if the claims that y'all are taking for your jokes, insults or judgment are false... I would actually be the one laughing at you, but I'm not because some claims (or lies if you want) put me in so much drama that it's getting absurd and cringe. 


Yours truly,

Edward Cake-Guindon aka Daddy Eddy
